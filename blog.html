                 <h4>Happy, Healthy Relationships </h4>
                 <p>Oh, to be happy in all our relationships!  But happiness is elusive. <br>
                Especially when old habits creep in. </p>
                 <p>Defensiveness is a habit I built from years of being left to my own “defenses.”  As a young girl, oftentimes I was alone with my siblings with little parental involvement.  Growing up with five brothers, I learned early that I was not loud enough or strong enough to force them to follow my will or get my way.  My efforts to control them arose out of the monster of fear that was deeply rooted in the core of my lonely soul. </p>
                 <p>Neutrality was a tactic I tried during my early teen years.  When our household was in upheaval, I would protect myself from the hurt I “knew” was going to happen if I spoke up.  My ears would hear the rage and aggression all around me, but my head and heart were neutralized. My mind wouldn’t allow me to face the monster of insecurity that neutralized me.</p>
                 <p>My teenage years found me knowing with certainty that my way was the right way.  I didn’t smoke, drink excessively, get pregnant or arrested.  This certainty was built from the battleground mentality I experienced all around me and, honestly, within me. </p>
                 <p>Bringing these traits into my marriage created a battleground mentality in my marriage.  Happiness was rarely exhibited by me.  I didn’t know what healthy looked like.  As I counseled with wise women, I learned to identify the negative feedback loop that raced through my thoughts and replace those thoughts with kind and loving messages. </p>
                 <p>Seeking creative solutions to my problems, such as teasing instead of sulking, reduced the stress when I would express a need.  My husband didn’t look for anyone else to blame in an effort to save face.  It became easy for both of us to acknowledge faults and laugh them off.</p>
                 <p>It took many years, but I can honestly say we have a happy and healthy relationship now.<br>
                 </p>
                 <p>Questions for you:<br>
                   Do you struggle with being happy? <br>
                   If so, why? <br>
                   If not, what is the secret to your success?<br>
                   What defense mechanisms do you exhibit when you are stressed?<br>
                   What is a new tactic you will try as you seek Happy, Healthy Relationships?<br>
                 </p>

                 <h4>A Rap to Haters                 </h4>
                 <p>Evil often begins with external sources, but when we allow it to take root within our souls, our hearts and minds are urged to join the coalition.  Attacks on our character can leave us angry and defeated and questioning our true nature.  Battling for right thinking is extremely difficult. </p>
                 <p>Combating evil takes time.  My personal journey through this battle took weeks to bring resolution. </p>
                 <p>The instructions were:<br>
                   EXPLAIN ME, DEFINE THEM, DECLARE THE HATE, RESOLVE THE FEELINGS</p>
                 <p>It took 30-minutes to compose the rap and hours to work through the emotions that arose from it. Diving into my reactions from being offended and assaulted and disrespected, I found a root of evil in my heart. </p>
                 <p>The truth is respect was not demonstrated to me, my heart, or my values.  I was not treated fairly.  Care or concern were not expressed to me.  Responsive listening was not possible with this group</p>
                 <p>As a Christian, I believed the Holy Spirit fought this war with me.  He declared and affirmed who I am according to God’s Word and the words of my loved ones.  Understanding that my integrity was at risk, I was responsible for recognizing their humanity and forgiving them for their actions.  This was the first step toward combating the evil taking hold.</p>
                 <p>Reminders that sinners sin came to me often.  As a sinner, I was not faultless in this or other situations.   Repentance must come from my heart before I could move toward forgiving the offenders.  And so I wept and worried and worked through the challenges.</p>
                 <p>In demonstrating respect for them and their values, as I struggled through my emotions, they were empowered to move forward with respect while the internal work continued.  During this time, I treated them with care and concern.  Trusting that my efforts to build positive relationships would pay dividends in the end.  My benevolence was sincere and I sought to promote happiness within them and improve relationships. </p>
                 <p>Over time, my soul submitted completely, once again, to my Savior and peace reigned in my heart while kindness moved more freely between us.  True repentance came from several of the perpetrators.  True forgiveness flowed from me, even for those who couldn’t or wouldn’t repent. </p>
                 <p>Questions for you:<br>
                   What “haters” have planted seeds of discord in your life?<br>
                   What would a good relationship with the hater look like?<br>
                   Are you willing to examine the event and explain who you are, define them, declare the hate, and resolve the feelings? <br>
                   If so, what is the first step?<br>
                   If not, what is keeping you from pursuing forgiveness?<br>
                 </p>
                 <p>Cornflower I Be<br>
                   Hair of bronze, skin of white, heart of gold, my love’s delight<br>
                   Words and love and passion matters<br>
                   I am more than the gossipy splatters<br>
                   Little known facts about the browns and blacks <br>
                   My loved ones of color have got my back</p>
                 <p>Unknowing Uncaring not curious at all<br>
                   Spiteful and mean and everything in between<br>
                   Are you afraid<br>
                   Are you intimidated<br>
                   Are you at all curious<br>
                   What will it take to open your eyes<br>
                   To remove the blinders with filters of lies</p>
                 <p>Forming alliances contrary to love <br>
                   Speaking out with and without thought of <br>
                   Me or my heart or my sensitivities<br>
                   My hurt my sorrow my pain my disease<br>
                   You judge and condemn without knowing me</p>
                 <p>We all have a choice to hold onto pain<br>
                   Deflect it reflect it and hope to find Gain<br>
                   But love will win out<br>
                   Sorrow will cease<br>
                   Joy will elate<br>
                   Fear will deflate<br>
                   Truth will define<br>
                   Not yours or mine <br>
                   Will you come near the line</p>
                 <p>Leave your sorrow behind <br>
                   Leave your fear in the past <br>
                   Open your heart and do it fast<br>
                   Hatred will not last <br>
                   The end is coming </p>
                 <p>Choose joy choose peace choose love choose forgiveness<br>
                   I choose joy and peace and love and forgiveness <br>
                   And you!</p>

                 <h4>Shadowy Leadership Leaves Scars</h4>
                 <p> Author’s note:  This essay is based on my story and Ethics of Life.  Respect for my story and my family is requested.<br>
                   Before You Start - Sit:  Five - I am the fifth of 7 children (5 boys, 2 girls).   My father, Bill, was a hard worker. He often worked two or more jobs six to seven days a week until he started his own business.  Then, he worked even longer hours.  Dad was a Boy Scout leader and often took us camping when we were young, to strengthen our survival skills.   When I became “a woman,” he no longer took me camping. <br>
                   Due to her many health issues, my mother, Tess, wasn’t active as a parent in my life until I was about 9.  By then, it was too late.  “I didn’t need her,” which was a good thing because her eyes were focused on her needs.  My mother was an incompetent leader. Mom worked outside the home and started college when I was 12, leaving me alone, much as she did when I was younger. She grew up “knowing that she was supposed to be a wife and mother and should be satisfied with the home and family she created,” but that family, that world, crumbled all around her.  She lacked the ability to function under stress and by “saving” herself, as she called it, her children suffered greatly.  Mom told me later, “I knew if I wasn’t healthy, my kids couldn’t get healthy.”  It only looked like selfishness to me. I sat and wallowed in abandonment.  Independence became my survival skill and my coat of armor. <br>
                   Before You Teach - Learn:  Having that background doesn’t mean there weren’t any leaders influencing me.  My sister, Terese, beginning at the age of 5, “parented” her siblings.  She  took on the responsibility of caring for my three older brothers and me (and the younger 2, when they came around).  She was our mother.  Needless to say, she didn’t receive training for that.  I learned what it meant to be kind and loving from her and, when she became pregnant at 17, I learned that I wanted to be a mom above all other things. <br>
                   During my teen years, Mom became vocal about women’s rights.  In the 1970s, Helen Reddy’s song I Am Woman (Hear Me Roar) streamed through our house and I was taken to seminars imploring women to aim higher and strive for more.  Mom tried to impress upon me the opportunities available to me - as a woman of the new era. When she asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, my response was, “I want to be a mommy.”  She was shocked and responded by pushing me to be a nurse.  Her new found knowledge didn’t sink into me, instead, I learned that the desire at the core of my soul wasn’t a good one.  My lessons continued to build me into what I became.<br>
                   Before You Help - Understand:  My siblings and I lived in the dark the shadow of inconsistency and unpredictability.  Neither parent led us well.  Though he was often absent, my father taught us how to stand tall in the face of trouble, take a deep breath (or a drag from a cigarette), and think before we spoke.  I understood that my opinions should be heard and accepted.  We all understood that he wasn’t going to tell us who we should be.  The consequence of this is that I didn’t know who I was.  Looking back, I realize my father was an insular leader.  He only came out of his self-centered life when he could no longer ignore the clamor of wife and children which grew louder as our emotional, physical, and spiritual needs were neglected.  My parents took care of themselves, but not their children.  Eventually, the physical and emotional distance of my parents brought our family to ruin.  I understood they would not, and could not, be my saviors.  Our parents abdicated responsibility, creating a dark shadow of irresponsibility, and then tried to pull us back under their wings when things spun out of control. <br>
                   I grew up under the shadow of mismanaged information, never knowing what was about to happen, never told why the electricity or water was disconnected or why another sibling was kicked out of the house (and my life).  My brothers, all 5 of them, by that time, taught me what NOT to do and who I did NOT want to be.  I was NOT going to run around with neighborhood kids causing trouble, smoking or drinking excessively, and “inviting” police to our house. <br>
                   During this time, one of our brothers gave up his life at the age of 25, when he was drunk and high and lost control of his motorcycle.  Raw pain and deep sorrow tore through our family.  The bleeding hearts and broken spirits of my parents was more than I could bear.  I was NOT going to die young and cause them and my siblings more harm.  At the same time, I understood I couldn’t help any of them.  As my older siblings moved out one-by-one, I understood that the only person supporting me emotionally was myself.  My unmet needs had left me maladjusted and malcontent. <br>
                   The first 20 years of my life developed a great void in my life.  I knew what I wanted - love and peace and joy.  I knew what I didn’t want - sorrow and anger and depression.  As a child, I was lost and hurting and had no adults to lead me out of that pit of despair and hopelessness.  As an adult, I could only see one way out.<br>
                   Before You Work - Commit:  Mike and Jenny sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g, first came love, then came marriage, then came three babies in a baby carriage.  As a mom who stayed home, trying to be the mom I never had, my failings were many.  I was a rigid leader.  My children were NOT going to become like my siblings.  My idea of success as a parent was that my children would NOT become addicted to drugs or alcohol; NOT become, or make someone else, pregnant; and all of them would graduate from high school. I was cynical and doubted anything good would come from my life, but they were going to have more, do more, and be more.  Depression and anger permeated my life in many ways, mostly directed at my mom and then turned on my husband. <br>
                   Transformation began after I went to a Christian church for the first time in October of 2006.  It took decades to learn who I was in God’s eyes.  During that time, He began to weed out the monsters of insecurity (being abandoned), fear (lack of resources - mental and physical), and battleground mentality (defensiveness) from my life. <br>
                   During the years of learning who I was (am), many good leaders built into my life.  My sister, Terese, led with love - ALWAYS!  My pastors, Jeff and Scott, led with truth and grace.  I learned to treasure good and faithful leaders and discovered that I could be a good leader too. <br>
                   Courage was the first leadership trait I exhibited, courage to speak truth in my marriage and stick it out when I changed the rules on my husband - courageous transformation occurred.  Compassion began to rule my life - regardless of assaults on my being from those who “loved” me.  The humble submission of Jesus’ to Father God’s will taught me humility in the face of that “love.”  Humility, gentle and patient, began to change our hearts.  Integrity was no longer about my beliefs and plans, but was based on God’s Word and His plan and purpose for me and my loved ones.  Hope, such a foreign word for my first 30 years, was planted and began to bloom.  It was so foreign to me that I thought it wasn’t real.  It was!  The greatest gift from heaven, was the gift of wisdom.  My focus moved off of me and onto the situations that surrounded me.  My eyes were opened to how and when I contributed to bad behavior and when I didn’t.  That led me to teach others how to see beyond the people and to the core.  By the grace of God, growing my children well and bringing healing to my marriage was my first leadership opportunity.  Guiding my loved ones out of compassion, humility, and wisdom allowed me to bring them to solid ground.  I was committed to building a better home and family than my family of origin provided.<br>
                   Before You Rest - Reflect:  My current leadership opportunity comes from working outside the home.  My great desire is to lead with wisdom, humility, and compassion while planting seeds of greatness and courage in my followers. Monsters of insecurity, fear and a battleground mentality are NOT leading me any longer.  I will NOT get sucked into power struggles and relationships with unethical leaders.  The healing power of Jesus changed my life.  My leadership style comes from Him.  All is well with my soul when I rest and reflect on the fact that I am a good, ethical leader. </p>
                 <p>Questions for you:<br>
                   How did shadowy leadership fail you? <br>
                   What tactics did you learn as you sought to be a great leader?<br>
                   Remember a story of a bad leadership example.  Write a new ending to that story.  Will you share it with someone?  If so, with whom?</p>
                 <p></p>
