            <p>Oh, to be happy in all our relationships!  But happiness is elusive. <br>
                Especially when old habits creep in...</p>   
                
                   <p>Defensiveness is a habit I built from years of being left to my own “defenses.”  As a young girl, oftentimes I was alone with my siblings with little parental involvement.  Growing up with five brothers, I learned early that I was not loud enough or strong enough to force them to follow my will or get my way.  My efforts to control them arose out of the monster of fear that was deeply rooted in the core of my lonely soul. </p>
                 <p>Neutrality was a tactic I tried during my early teen years.  When our household was in upheaval, I would protect myself from the hurt I “knew” was going to happen if I spoke up.  My ears would hear the rage and aggression all around me, but my head and heart were neutralized. My mind wouldn’t allow me to face the monster of insecurity that neutralized me.</p>
                 <p>My teenage years found me knowing with certainty that my way was the right way.  I didn’t smoke, drink excessively, get pregnant or arrested.  This certainty was built from the battleground mentality I experienced all around me and, honestly, within me. </p>
                 <p>Bringing these traits into my marriage created a battleground mentality in my marriage.  Happiness was rarely exhibited by me.  I didn’t know what healthy looked like.  As I counseled with wise women, I learned to identify the negative feedback loop that raced through my thoughts and replace those thoughts with kind and loving messages. </p>
                 <p>Seeking creative solutions to my problems, such as teasing instead of sulking, reduced the stress when I would express a need.  My husband didn’t look for anyone else to blame in an effort to save face.  It became easy for both of us to acknowledge faults and laugh them off.</p>
                 <p>It took many years, but I can honestly say we have a happy and healthy relationship now.<br>
                 </p>
                 <p>Questions for you:<br>
                   Do you struggle with being happy? <br>
                   If so, why? <br>
                   If not, what is the secret to your success?<br>
                   What defense mechanisms do you exhibit when you are stressed?<br>
                   What is a new tactic you will try as you seek Happy, Healthy Relationships?<br>

<div id="topic02" class="hdn">
   <p>Evil often begins with external sources, but when we allow it to take root within our souls, our hearts and minds are urged to join the coalition.  Attacks on our character can leave us angry and defeated and questioning our true nature.  Battling for right thinking is extremely difficult. </p>
                 
                 <p>Combating evil takes time.  My personal journey through this battle took weeks to bring resolution. </p>
                 <p>The instructions were:<br>
                   EXPLAIN ME, DEFINE THEM, DECLARE THE HATE, RESOLVE THE FEELINGS</p>
                 <p>It took 30-minutes to compose the rap and hours to work through the emotions that arose from it. Diving into my reactions from being offended and assaulted and disrespected, I found a root of evil in my heart. </p>
                 <p>The truth is respect was not demonstrated to me, my heart, or my values.  I was not treated fairly.  Care or concern were not expressed to me.  Responsive listening was not possible with this group</p>
                 <p>As a Christian, I believed the Holy Spirit fought this war with me.  He declared and affirmed who I am according to God’s Word and the words of my loved ones.  Understanding that my integrity was at risk, I was responsible for recognizing their humanity and forgiving them for their actions.  This was the first step toward combating the evil taking hold.</p>
                 <p>Reminders that sinners sin came to me often.  As a sinner, I was not faultless in this or other situations.   Repentance must come from my heart before I could move toward forgiving the offenders.  And so I wept and worried and worked through the challenges.</p>
                 <p>In demonstrating respect for them and their values, as I struggled through my emotions, they were empowered to move forward with respect while the internal work continued.  During this time, I treated them with care and concern.  Trusting that my efforts to build positive relationships would pay dividends in the end.  My benevolence was sincere and I sought to promote happiness within them and improve relationships. </p>
                 <p>Over time, my soul submitted completely, once again, to my Savior and peace reigned in my heart while kindness moved more freely between us.  True repentance came from several of the perpetrators.  True forgiveness flowed from me, even for those who couldn’t or wouldn’t repent. </p>
                 <p>Questions for you:<br>
                   What “haters” have planted seeds of discord in your life?<br>
                   What would a good relationship with the hater look like?<br>
                   Are you willing to examine the event and explain who you are, define them, declare the hate, and resolve the feelings? <br>
                   If so, what is the first step?<br>
                   If not, what is keeping you from pursuing forgiveness?<br>
                 </p>
                 <p>Cornflower I Be<br>
                   Hair of bronze, skin of white, heart of gold, my love’s delight<br>
                   Words and love and passion matters<br>
                   I am more than the gossipy splatters<br>
                   Little known facts about the browns and blacks <br>
                   My loved ones of color have got my back</p>
                 <p>Unknowing Uncaring not curious at all<br>
                   Spiteful and mean and everything in between<br>
                   Are you afraid<br>
                   Are you intimidated<br>
                   Are you at all curious<br>
                   What will it take to open your eyes<br>
                   To remove the blinders with filters of lies</p>
                 <p>Forming alliances contrary to love <br>
                   Speaking out with and without thought of <br>
                   Me or my heart or my sensitivities<br>
                   My hurt my sorrow my pain my disease<br>
                   You judge and condemn without knowing me</p>
                 <p>We all have a choice to hold onto pain<br>
                   Deflect it reflect it and hope to find Gain<br>
                   But love will win out<br>
                   Sorrow will cease<br>
                   Joy will elate<br>
                   Fear will deflate<br>
                   Truth will define<br>
                   Not yours or mine <br>
                   Will you come near the line</p>
                 <p>Leave your sorrow behind <br>
                   Leave your fear in the past <br>
                   Open your heart and do it fast<br>
                   Hatred will not last <br>
                   The end is coming </p>
                 <p>Choose joy choose peace choose love choose forgiveness<br>
                   I choose joy and peace and love and forgiveness <br>
                   And you!</p>
