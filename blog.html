                 <h4>Happy, Healthy Relationships</h4>
                    <p>Oh, to be happy in all our relationships!  But happiness is elusive. <br>
                    Especially when old habits creep in. </p>
                    <p>Defensiveness is a habit I built from years of being left to my own “defenses.”  As a young girl, oftentimes I was alone with my siblings with little parental involvement.  Growing up with five brothers, I learned early that I was not loud enough or strong enough to force them to follow my will or get my way.  My efforts to control them arose out of the monster of fear that was deeply rooted in the core of my lonely soul. </p>
                    <p>Neutrality was a tactic I tried during my early teen years.  When our household was in upheaval, I would protect myself from the hurt I “knew” was going to happen if I spoke up.  My ears would hear the rage and aggression all around me, but my head and heart were neutralized. My mind wouldn’t allow me to face the monster of insecurity that neutralized me.</p>
                    <p>My teenage years found me knowing with certainty that my way was the right way.  I didn’t smoke, drink excessively, get pregnant or arrested.  This certainty was built from the battleground mentality I experienced all around me and, honestly, within me. </p>
                    <p>Bringing these traits into my marriage created a battleground mentality in my marriage.  Happiness was rarely exhibited by me.  I didn’t know what healthy looked like.  As I counseled with wise women, I learned to identify the negative feedback loop that raced through my thoughts and replace those thoughts with kind and loving messages. </p>
                    <p>Seeking creative solutions to my problems, such as teasing instead of sulking, reduced the stress when I would express a need.  My husband didn’t look for anyone else to blame in an effort to save face.  It became easy for both of us to acknowledge faults and laugh them off.</p>
                    <p>It took many years, but I can honestly say we have a happy and healthy relationship now.</p>
